   <p style="background-color: rgba(188, 190, 232, 0.575);"> Kohli made his first-class debut on 23 November 2006, playing for Delhi against Tamil Nadu in a Ranji Trophy match at Feroz Shah Kotla. The match was drawn, and Kohli scored 10 in his only innings.[2] He has played continuously for Delhi ever since, and they have been his sole first-class team, other than India in Test cricket.[1] They have won the Ranji Trophy once during his time with them, in 2007/08.[3] Kohli played in five matches that season, scoring two centuries,[4] but he was not in their team for the final, when they defeated Uttar Pradesh by 9 wickets.[5]

Kohli joined the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) ahead of the first-ever Indian Premier League (IPL) tournament in April 2008. The opening match was at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore (now Bengaluru). RCB hosted the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), but lost by 140 runs. Kohli was third in their batting order and was bowled by Ashok Dinda for one run.[6] Having been runners-up three times, RCB won the IPL for the first time in 2025. In the final against Punjab Kings, RCB batted first, and Kohli opened the innings with Philip Salt. He scored 43 from 35 balls, the top score for RCB. They totalled 190/9 in their 20 overs, and restricted Kings to 184/7, winning the match by six runs.[7]

As with Delhi, Kohli has remained loyal to RCB and has not played for any other franchise team.[ </p>
